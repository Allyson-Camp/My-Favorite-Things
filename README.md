# Build a page with a form containing input fields where users may enter several of their favorite things.

# Then, write code that gathers each of these form input values and places them into one array.

# After this is done, use your site to practice targeting and moving elements between arrays:
  - Use square bracket notation to access the second, first, and third elements of the original array of favorite things.
  - Then, use Array.prototype.push() to add only these elements (2nd, 1st, and 3rd) to a brand new array.
  - Finally, display this new array in your page's HTML as list items in a <ul> tag. Use the document.createElement() and Element.append() or Element.prepend() methods to create and add elements to your webpage.
